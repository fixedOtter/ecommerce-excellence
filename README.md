## Project Criteria
```
It begins life as a functional Express.js API
The user can then add their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
The user is then able to connect to the database using Sequelize
Once they enter schema and seed commands, a database is created and is seeded with test data
Once the user enters the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
The user can then open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, and receive the data for each of these routes displayed in a formatted JSON
The user can then test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core and is able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
